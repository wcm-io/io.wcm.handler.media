## Media Handler Granite UI components

*Please note:* These Granite UI components are only supported in AEM 6.3 and higher.

### Media Handler-aware File Upload

![File Upload Component](images/fileupload-component.png)

This is a customized File Upload component that allows to reference AEM assets or upload binary files as inline assets with enhanced support for the wcm.io Media Handler.

```json-jcr
"fileReference": {
  "sling:resourceType": "wcm-io/handler/media/components/granite/form/fileupload",
  "fieldLabel": "Asset reference"
}
```

Enhancements over AEM version:

* A path field is additionally displayed which shows the references of the selected asset, and allows to browse it directly alternatively to drag & drop from the asset finder. The root path of this path field can be configured with the `rootPath` property.
* The referenced asset is checked automatically against the configured set of media formats. A warning is displayed in the edit dialog when the selected asset does not match with the media formats. The media formats are taken from the [component properties][component-properties], or can be set directly for the edit dialog using the properties `mediaFormats`, `mediaFormatsMandatory` and `mediaCropAuto`.
* The property `rootPath` is automatically set to the default DAM root path in the Media Handler configuration, and defaults to `/content/dam`.
* The properties `name`, `fileNameParameter` and `fileReferenceParameter` are set automatically to their default values as configured in the Media Handler configuration. They only have to be set on the component if different values should be used for a component (e.g. when multiple asset references are stored for one component).
* When the property `fieldDescription` is not set, it is set automatically with information about the expected media formats
* The property `allowUpload` is set to `false` by default
* The property `mimeTypes` is pre-initialized with mimetypes for GIF, JPEG and PNG images
